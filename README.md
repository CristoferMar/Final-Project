## Motivation
Since learning how to code, I wanted to create an app that would be aesthetically pleasing and also functional for everyone, in more than one way. After learning how to impletment a Node.js server and PostreSQL databse, I was able to put my vision together and create this full-stack project. I've always been a fan of party games and of keeping dates interesting with unexpected destinations. So why not create an app that could offer this many uses, to the client.

## Technologies Used
**Client Side**
* Built using **React** for a responsive and dynamic front-end experience
* Kept my styling as universal as possible by creating reusable **CSS** classes
* Sent **API calls** to my server via **Fetch** requests
**Server Side**
* Impletmented server side with **Express**
* Manages user loginauthentication with **Argon2**, **JSON Web Tokens**, and **localStorage**
**Database**
* Used PostgreSQL database to store users, lists, date ideas, and history for each account
