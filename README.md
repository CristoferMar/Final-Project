## Motivation
Since learning how to code, I wanted to create an app that would be aesthetically pleasing and functional for everyone in more than one way. After learning how to implement a Node.js server and PostgreSQL databases, I was able to put my vision together and create this full-stack project. I've always been a fan of party games and keeping dates interesting with unexpected destinations. So why not make an app that could offer this and other uses to the client.

## Technologies Used
**Client Side**
* Built using **React** for a responsive and dynamic front-end experience
* Kept my styling as universal as possible by creating reusable **CSS** classes
* Sent **API calls** to my server via **Fetch** requests
**Server Side**
* Implemented server side with **Express**
* Managed user login authentication with **Argon2**, **JSON Web Tokens**, and **localStorage**
**Database**
* Used PostgreSQL database to store users, lists, date ideas, and history for each account

## Features
**Current Features**
1. Users can view their own lists
2. Users can create a custom list
3. Users can add date ideas to their lists
4. Users can view their date lists
5. Users can generate a date idea with a price filter
6. Users can sign In

2. Clone the OneTwoDate repository.
3. Open the terminal to the OneTwoDate repository.
4. Run the command `npm install` to download the necessary npm packages.
5. Run the command `cp .env.example .env` to create a .env file for the application.
6. In the `.env` file, change the `TOKEN_SECRET` to a suitable value.

11. Run the command `npm run db:import` to import the schema and initial data.
12. Run the command `npm run dev` to start the server and run the client as a live server.
